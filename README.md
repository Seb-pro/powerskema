# powerskema

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm

### Getting started

If you just want to see the project click here [here](https://powerskema.vercel.app/home)

If you want to continue developing the project run the following command on your local environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/Seb-pro/powerskema.git
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```
ionic serve
```

Open http://localhost:8100 with your favorite browser to see the website. For your information, it might take some time for it to compile the project for your first time.

### Practical guidelines

- When starting create your own branch from Master
- Name the branch with meaningful name starting with "feature/" f.ex feature/create-footer
- Create a draft pull request with your new branch
- When pushing your work, do so in small chunks which are relevant for a particular feature you are working on, this way the code is easier to review
